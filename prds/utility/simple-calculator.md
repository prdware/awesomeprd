## 5. Functional Requirements
### Core Features
The app must support the following basic arithmetic operations:
- **Addition (+)**: Sum of two or more numbers.
- **Subtraction (-)**: Difference between numbers.
- **Multiplication (×)**: Product of numbers.
- **Division (÷)**: Quotient of numbers, with handling for division by zero (display error message).

Additional essentials:
- Decimal point (.) for non-integer calculations.
- Parentheses ( ) for grouping operations (e.g., (2+3)×4).
- Clear (C) button to reset current input.
- Equals (=) to evaluate the expression.
- Backspace to delete last digit/operator.

### User Flows
1. **Simple Calculation**:
   - User enters numbers and operators via on-screen buttons.
   - Taps = to display result.
   - Example: 5 + 3 × 2 = (Result: 11, respecting order of operations).

2. **History Viewing**:
   - After calculation, entry is added to a scrollable history list.
   - User can tap an entry to copy result or re-edit expression.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Invalid input (e.g., operator without number): Highlight error and suggest correction.
   - Division by zero: Display "Error: Division by Zero".
