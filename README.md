# Awesome PRD

Welcome to **Awesome PRD**, a curated repository of Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) designed to empower everyone—technical and non-technical alike—to create bespoke applications using AI tools. Inspired by the PRDware movement, this repo is a digital commons where ideas are shared freely as PRDs, ready to be forked, tweaked, and transformed into apps tailored to your needs.

## What is PRDware?

PRDware is a modern evolution of the freeware and open-source software movements, reimagined for the AI age. Instead of sharing code or executables, we share PRDs—clear, natural-language documents that outline an app’s features, user flows, and goals. These PRDs can be fed into AI tools to generate fully functional apps. By making PRDs accessible and editable, we democratize app creation, enabling anyone with a vision to build without coding expertise.

**Why now?** AI can already generate small apps from concise PRDs, and soon it will handle nearly any app imaginable. This is the moment to establish an open ecosystem for shared PRDs, ensuring innovation remains inclusive and collaborative.

## About This Repository

Awesome PRD is a community-driven collection of high-quality PRDs for a wide range of applications—from productivity tools to educational apps, creative projects, and beyond. Each PRD is:
- Written in plain language for accessibility.
- Released into the **public domain** (CC0), free to use, modify, and share without restriction.
- Designed to be AI-compatible, with clear structure for generating apps.
- Open to contributions, so the community can refine and expand the collection.

Every app generated from these PRDs should include a link to the original PRD and a statement that the PRD and its derivatives are in the public domain.

## Getting Started

1. **Browse the PRDs**: Explore the `/prds` directory to find a PRD that matches your needs or inspires your next project.
2. **Tweak a PRD**: Fork a PRD and modify it to fit your unique requirements using any text editor.
3. **Generate Your App**: Feed the PRD into an AI tool (like those supporting code generation from natural language) to create your app.
4. **Share Back**: If you create a new PRD or improve an existing one, contribute it to the repo!

## Repository Structure

- `/prds`: Contains all PRDs, organized by category (e.g., `/productivity`, `/education`, `/creative`).
- `/templates`: Provides PRD templates to help you write your own.
- `/examples`: Showcases sample apps generated from PRDs in this repo (with links to their PRDs).
- `/docs`: Guides on writing effective PRDs and using AI tools for generation.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! To contribute:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Add or improve a PRD in the `/prds` directory, following our [PRD Guidelines](docs/prd-guidelines.md).
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
4. Ensure your PRD is released into the public domain (CC0).

## PRD Guidelines

- Write in clear, concise language (English or any other language).
- Include key sections: Overview, Features, User Stories, Edge Cases, and Constraints.
- Specify any assumptions or ethical considerations.
- Ensure the PRD is AI-friendly: avoid ambiguity, use structured formats where possible.
- Declare the PRD as public domain (CC0) in the document.

## Example PRDs

- [Interval Walking Coach PRD](prds/exercise/interval-walking-coach.md): A simple coach to help you with interval walking.
- [Daily Mood Tracker PRD](prds/health/daily-mood-tracker.md): A daily mood tracker.
- [Simple Calculator PRD](prds/utility/simple-calculator.md): A simple calculator.

## Why Contribute?

By sharing PRDs, you:
- Empower others to create apps without coding.
- Foster a collaborative ecosystem of ideas.
- Help shape the future of software creation in the AI age.
